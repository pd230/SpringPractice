    error : Web server failed to start. Port 8080 was already in use.
    solution : stop the process that's listening on port 8080 or configure this application to listen on another port.
             src/main/resources/application.properties
              Add:
                  server.port=8070 (add any port number)

   Even after changing the port, the application still says "port already in use", and the process keeps running 
   the background.
   reason : When you stop the app from your IDE, it doesn't always kill the background Java process So when you
            restart it, even on a different port, the JVM from the previous run might still be alive, holding the port.
   solution : 1.Always use the red stop button to kill the app.
              2.Check in your IDE: Run → Show Running List or Terminate All.
              3.kill running process : 
                     netstat -ano | findstr :8080
                     taskkill /PID 8916 /F
